# Disclaimer

This repository is provided **for educational and research purposes only**. It demonstrates Modbus/ICS protocol usage in a **controlled, local environment** and is not intended for use against production systems.

- The code **defaults to loopback (127.0.0.1)** and contains no hard-coded real-world targets.
- Any use against external networks, industrial devices, or third-party equipment requires explicit authorization from the device/network owner and may be illegal.
- To target non-local systems the code must be **deliberately modified**; those modifications are the responsibility of the modifier.

⚠️ **Unauthorized use against live industrial systems, networks, or equipment is illegal and unethical.**  
The authors and contributors assume **no liability** for damage, data loss, or legal violations caused by misuse of this repository.

If you discover a security vulnerability in real devices/software while researching, please follow responsible disclosure best practices and notify the affected vendor(s) and any relevant CERT (e.g., national CERT) rather than publishing exploitation instructions.
